    <!--It's a good idea to provide an RSS feed of privacy policy updates so that users don't have to keep checking back to see if anything has changed. Especially if your feed doesn't change regularly, it doesn't take much work to update it by hand whenever you make a change. Of course, whenever you make a large change, it's still a good idea to push a notice out to your users, even if you do have an RSS feed. Make sure to remove the RSS section below if you don't use an update feed.-->

              <h4 id="collection_tracking">
                KEIphone, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of our users and being a proactive advocate for consumer protection. Our data privacy policy is based on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standard – widely considered to be the most pro-consumer data privacy legislation in the world.

              <h4 id="collection_tracking">
                We believe the most important measure of consumer protection is also the simplest – asking ourselves how we would want to be treated as customers. With this overall philosophy in mind, our data privacy policy is based on three simple commitments to our users:
                
                We will never disclose, share, or sell your personal data. Your individual data belongs to you. We will never share it without your explicit consent. Any data we share will be anonymized and aggregated.
                We will keep your data secure at all times. We will use the highest industry standard security technology to protect your data while it is stored on your phone, in transmission over the internet, and on our servers. We will always notify you if there has been any security breach with your data.
                Your data will always be available to you. You will always be able to access your personal data, even if you stop using our products. We will never charge you to access your own information.
                We will remove your data from our systems anytime you want. If you decide to stop using our products and no longer want your historical information to be saved by us, we will be happy to permanently remove it from all of our systems.

              <h4 id="collection_tracking">
                We collect information from our users in two ways:
                Directly when you provide it to us. When you create an account in our products, you enter personal information such as your name, phone number, and passcode. This information is used to complete your user profile, send you personalized transaction summaries, and allow you to securely login and access your private information.
                Automatically as you use our products. When you use our products, we also collect information automatically to personalize your user experience and help us support you proactively when you have questions or problems.
